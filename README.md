# Analyze Promotions and Provide Tangible Insights to Sales Director

## 1. Project Overview:

### Company Info:
AtliQ Mart is a retail giant with over 50 supermarkets in the southern region of India. All their 50 stores ran a massive promotion during the Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024 (festive time in India) on their AtliQ branded products. Now the sales director wants to understand which promotions did well and which did not so that they can make informed decisions for their next promotional period.

## 2. Project Info:

### Primary Insights:

#### I. Store Performance Analysis:

- Bottom 10 stores by Incremental Sold Units (ISU).
- Variation of store performance by city. Common characteristics among top-performing stores.

#### II. Promotion Type Analysis:
- Top 2 promotion types for highest Incremental Revenue.
- Bottom 2 promotion types for impact on Incremental Sold Units.
- Comparison of performance: discount-based vs. BOGOF vs. cashback promotions.
- Promotions balancing Incremental Sold Units and healthy margins.

#### III. Product and Category Analysis:
- Product categories with highest sales lift from promotions.
- Specific products' response to promotions.
- Correlation between product category and promotion type effectiveness.

## 3. Work Done:

- Analyzed citywise revenue using bar and line charts, including store counts and revenues before and after promotions.
- Created calculated variables such as Incremental Sold Units (ISU) and percentages for store metrics overview, displaying results in a table.
- Visualized category sales dynamics with donut and pie charts for before and after promotion periods.
- Summarized revenue trends by stores in a table, incorporating calculated metrics like Incremental Revenue (IR) and ISU.
- Used `value_counts()` to get promo type frequencies and created a waterfall chart for visualization.
